experimental_grasscovering
==========================

* Ability to plant on any Ground in home base. Planting turned ground into HardGround.
* You could soften hard ground for 11 water each.
* You start with a Shovel and can Uproot one contiguous patch of grass per level.
* You can then plant the Grass at home, which would get used up in place of ground erosion.
* Shrinking level to be a bit more space constrained.

- Pros
  - I like that the grasses are somehow involved.
  - I like that there's limited space.
- Cons
  - There isn't really any choice or long term strategy involved.
  - Homebase is cluttered - items strewn on the floor
  - Where I plant is dictated solely by which area has no HardGround, so I can't make it look nice
  - Water is still the only limiting resource

Verdict: scrap it and do the new gardening idea

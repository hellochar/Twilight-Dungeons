experimental_retryondemand
==========================

- Like: incentivizes optimizing and lets you replay a hard level and try again when you'd die.
- Dislike: you get "sloppy" and the moment you take a damage or mess up in any way you might as well restart.

Verdict: new idea for only retrying after beating a level

experimental_equipmentperfloor
=============================

- Pros: You don't have to fiddle with equipping/unequipping all the time. There's less nitpickiness around using an item *just one time*. Makes an item feel impactful.
- Cons: One less dimension and mechanic to play with. The moment you use an item basically makes the entire level a breeze because you're choosing to "easy mode" the level from then on.
- Goal: reduce item fiddling, have impactful "turn the tides" plays, feel smart about using the tools you have to get out of a tricky situation

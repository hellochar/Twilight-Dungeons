experimental_grasscovering
==========================

* Ability to plant on any Ground in home base. Planting turned ground into HardGround.
* You could soften hard ground for 11 water each.
* You start with a Shovel and can Uproot one contiguous patch of grass per level.
* You can then plant the Grass at home, which would get used up in place of ground erosion.
* Shrinking level to be a bit more space constrained.

- Pros
  - I like that the grasses are somehow involved.
  - I like that there's limited space.
- Cons
  - There isn't really any choice or long term strategy involved.
  - Homebase is cluttered - items strewn on the floor
  - Where I plant is dictated solely by which area has no HardGround, so I can't make it look nice
  - Water is still the only limiting resource

Verdict: scrap it and do the new gardening idea

experimental_retryondemand
==========================

- Like: incentivizes optimizing and lets you replay a hard level and try again when you'd die.
- Dislike: you get "sloppy" and the moment you take a damage or mess up in any way you might as well restart.

Verdict: new idea for only retrying after beating a level

experimental_equipmentperfloor
=============================

- Pros: You don't have to fiddle with equipping/unequipping all the time. There's less nitpickiness around using an item *just one time*. Makes an item feel impactful.
- Cons: One less dimension and mechanic to play with. The moment you use an item basically makes the entire level a breeze because you're choosing to "easy mode" the level from then on.
- Goal: reduce item fiddling, have impactful "turn the tides" plays, feel smart about using the tools you have to get out of a tricky situation
